# K2 Advanced Biofuel

This repo contains a Factorio mod that adds a technology, recipe, and item
for Advanced Biofuel to the existing mod Krastorio 2. The new fuel is
comparable to Advanced Fuel, except that it is created from Biofuel and has
slightly lower top speed and accleration modifiers but also a significantly
lower pollution modifier.

## Disclaimer

This mod is neither created by nor affiliated with the creators of
Krastorio 2. Do not report issues with this mod to them.

## Building the Mod

To build the mod from source, you will need to install `jq`, `zip`, and
`make`. Then run `make clean zip` and the properly named and structured
zip file for the mod will be created in the `output` directory.
